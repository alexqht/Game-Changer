Just another repository
Hello , i never thought i will return back to coding , after giving it up after my graduation in 2004 , had i known that i fucking need coding ,why the hell i choose to following a technical supporting engineer to start my careeer, why shouldn't i just jump into the ground spring and emerge myslef into it , was that the case , i would have had 13 years of coding experience , isnt awesome !  but that is not a dream
